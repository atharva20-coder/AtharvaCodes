> - A key difference is that SoK projects are not limited to code-focused work, but any that benefit our community. For instance, projects can be about documentation, reports, translation, system administration, web and other types of work including code as well.

## 24 Pull Requests

> - 24 Pull Requests goal is to encourage contribution to open source projects during December. The site suggests open projects, highlights tickets that are good for new contributors, provides guides for contributing and promotes good contributions submitted each day.
> - The idea is simple: 'Send 24 pull requests between December 1st and December 24th', encouraging contributors to give back to open source projects with little gifts of code throughout December.
